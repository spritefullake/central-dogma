# Central Dogma of Biology
##### Input genetic codes and obtain the results of various genetic processes!

### Features
* Exhibits DNA replication, RNA replication, transcription, reverse transcription and translation. 
* Displays codons and anticodons

***
*DNA → RNA → Protein*

This ↑ is the central dogma of biology: DNA codes for RNA which codes for protein...

Actually, it's not that simple. For example, introns in DNA are spiced out from pre-mRNA; only the **ex**ons get **ex**ported to mRNA. And not all RNA codes for protein; consider tRNAs, snRNAs and microRNAs. Still the general concept of genetic codes reflects the wonder of life: small, limited sets of molecules can carry all the information required for creating an organism. 

Hopefully this software program gives an insight into the genetic program behind living things.
